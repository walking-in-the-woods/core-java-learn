java.nio package

We should use character data (text format) to work with text reports, XML and JSON data.
We should use byte data (binary format) to work with program variables or classes

Sequential (serial) access can be thought as a stream of data that arrives at the program our is sent out from it.
Random access only really applies to files and allows us to jump about the file or within the file retrieving
or overriding any data in any location is more like using a database.
